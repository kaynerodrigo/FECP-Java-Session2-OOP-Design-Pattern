### Project Title
Hospital Billing System

### Brief Description
This project is a command-line application that simulates a hospital billing system. It allows users to register patients, add various medical services to a patient's account, and compute the final bill based on different insurance or payment schemes. The system is built using Java and demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and key design patterns, specifically the Factory and Strategy patterns.

### Project Structure
The application is designed using a modular, object-oriented approach to ensure clarity, reusability, and ease of maintenance.
